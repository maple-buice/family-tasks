# Family Tasks

App for managing my family's schedules and making sure things get done.

More details and specs to come...

## Note

I started from the .NET CLI react template because it lays out and wires up the front and backend for rapid development. I rearranged a little to make it easier to navigate (by default all the server code is in the root). The UI is in [https://github.com/maple-buice/family-tasks/ClientApp. ](https://github.com/maple-buice/family-tasks/tree/main/ClientApp)

You'll need to install [.NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)

I'd recommend working in VSCode with the [C# plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) installed.

Everything is set up to just hit the "Run" (or Debug) button in the IDE and it'll spin up the frontend and backend and get you going. The first time you launch it it'll ask you to generate a local development cert. Do that.
